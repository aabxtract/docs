description: Build a Next.js app on Base using OnchainKit
---

Welcome to the Base quickstart! This walkthrough will guide you through creating a simple onchain app from scratch. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, you'll be up and running quickly.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working onchain app that:

- Connects to the Base network
- Deploys smart contracts to Base Sepolia (testnet)
- Interacts with your contracts through a web interface

You'll build an onchain tally counter that increments a value stored in a smart contract whenever you press a button.

<Tip>
**Why Base?**

Base is a fast, low-cost Ethereum L2 designed to bring the next billion users onchain. Join a vibrant ecosystem of developers and creators building the global onchain economy.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Node.js v19+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic familiarity with React and TypeScript
- A wallet with Base Sepolia ETH (get free testnet ETH from [these faucets](/base-chain/tools/network-faucets))

## Set Up Your Development Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your OnchainKit project">
  OnchainKit provides ready-to-use React components and TypeScript utilities for building onchain apps. Create your project by running:

  ```bash Terminal
  npm create onchain@latest
  ```

  The setup will prompt you for a CDP API Key. Get yours from the [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys/client-key).

  After completing the prompts, start your development server:

  ```bash Terminal
  cd my-onchainkit-app
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  Open your browser to see the default OnchainKit template running:

  <Frame>
    <img alt="OnchainKit Template" src="/images/onchainkit/quickstart.png" height="364" />
  </Frame>

  Next, we'll add smart contract functionality to this app.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Foundry for smart contracts">
  Foundry is a toolkit for Ethereum development written in Rust. We'll use it to write, test, and deploy our smart contracts.

  1. Create a contracts directory in your project root:

  ```bash Terminal
  mkdir contracts && cd contracts
  ```

  2. Install Foundry and initialize a new project:

  ```bash Terminal
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  foundryup
  forge init --no-git
  ```

  <Tip>
  **Using --no-git**

  Since `contracts` is a subdirectory in your existing project, we use `--no-git` to avoid creating a nested git repository.
  </Tip>

  Open `contracts/src/Counter.sol` to see the smart contract we'll deploy. It includes simple increment and decrement functions for our tally counter.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Base network connection">
  To deploy contracts to Base, you need:

  1. **RPC endpoints** to connect to the Base network
  2. **A funded wallet** to pay for deployment gas fees

  Create a `.env` file in your `contracts` directory:

  ```bash contracts/.env
  BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
  BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.base.org"
  ```

  Load these environment variables:

  ```bash Terminal
  source .env
  ```

  <Tip>
  **About Base Sepolia**

  Base Sepolia is the testnet for Base. Use it for development and testing without spending real ETH. Get free testnet ETH from [Base faucets](/base-chain/tools/network-faucets).
  </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your deployment wallet">
  You need a private key with testnet funds to deploy contracts. Generate a new private key using [VisualKey](https://visualkey.link/).

  1. Store your private key securely in Foundry's keystore:

  ```bash Terminal
  cast wallet import deployer --interactive
  ```

  2. Enter your private key and create a password when prompted.

  Your private key is now encrypted and stored in `~/.foundry/keystores`, which is not tracked by git.

  <Warning>
  **Protect Your Private Key**
  
  Never share, commit, or expose your private key. Treat it like a password. For production deployments, use hardware wallets or secure key management systems.
  </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy Your Smart Contract

With your environment configured, you're ready to deploy the Counter contract to Base Sepolia.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compile and deploy your contract">
  Run this command to compile and deploy `Counter.sol`:

  ```bash Terminal
  forge create ./src/Counter.sol:Counter --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --account deployer
  ```

  Enter your keystore password when prompted. The format `<contract-path>:<contract-name>` tells Foundry which contract to deploy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save your contract address">
  After successful deployment, you'll see the contract address in the console output. Copy it and add it to your `contracts/.env` file:

  ```bash contracts/.env
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x..."
  ```

  Load the updated environment variables:

  ```bash Terminal
  source .env
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify deployment">
  Confirm your contract deployed correctly:

  1. **Check on Basescan**: Search for your contract address on [Sepolia Basescan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/)

  2. **Query the contract**: Use Foundry's `cast` tool to read the current counter value:

  ```bash Terminal
  cast call $COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "number()(uint256)" --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
  ```

  This should return `0`, the initial value of the counter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Success!** Your smart contract is now live on Base Sepolia. Next, we'll connect it to your frontend.

## Connect Your Frontend to the Contract

Now we'll add a button to your app that increments the onchain counter. OnchainKit's `Transaction` component handles the entire transaction flow, including wallet connection, transaction submission, and status updates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Transaction component">
  Open `app/page.tsx` and replace the contents of the `main` tag with:

  ```tsx app/page.tsx
  // @noErrors: 2307 - Cannot find module '@/calls'
  import { Transaction } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/transaction';
  import { calls } from '@/calls';

  <main className="flex flex-grow items-center justify-center">
    <div className="w-full max-w-4xl p-4">
      <div className="mx-auto mb-6 w-1/3">
        <Transaction calls={calls} />
      </div>
    </div>
  </main>;
  ```

  The `Transaction` component provides a complete transaction UI with a submit button and toast notifications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define your contract interaction">
  The `calls` import specifies which contract function to execute. Create `app/calls.ts` with:

  ```ts app/calls.ts
  const counterContractAddress = '0x...'; // Replace with your contract address
  const counterContractAbi = [
    {
      type: 'function',
      name: 'increment',
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
    },
  ] as const;

  export const calls = [
    {
      address: counterContractAddress,
      abi: counterContractAbi,
      functionName: 'increment',
      args: [],
    },
  ];
  ```

  Replace `'0x...'` with the contract address you saved earlier.

  <Tip>
  **About the ABI**

  The ABI (Application Binary Interface) defines how to interact with your smart contract. We only include the `increment` function since that's all we need.
  </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your app">
  1. **Connect your wallet**: Click the wallet button in your app and connect using a wallet with Base Sepolia ETH

  2. **Increment the counter**: Click "Transact" and approve the transaction in your wallet

  3. **Verify onchain**: After the transaction confirms, check that the counter incremented:

  ```bash Terminal
  cast call $COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "number()(uint256)" --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
  ```

  The value should now be `1` (or higher if you clicked multiple times).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Congratulations!** You've built a complete onchain app. While simple, this demonstrates the full development cycle:

- Set up a project with frontend and smart contract infrastructure
- Deployed a contract to Base Sepolia
- Connected your frontend to interact with the deployed contract

## Next Steps

Enhance your app with these features:

- **Gasless transactions**: Sponsor user transactions with [Paymaster](/onchainkit/transaction/transaction#sponsor-with-paymaster-capabilities) so users don't pay gas fees
- **Better wallet UX**: Improve sign-in and wallet connection with the [WalletModal](/onchainkit/wallet/wallet-modal) component
- **Onchain identity**: Add [Identity](/onchainkit/identity/identity) components to display user names and avatars
- **Deploy to mainnet**: Once tested, deploy to Base mainnet for real users
- **Add more functionality**: Expand your contract with additional features like decrement, reset, or multiple counters
