# Base App Beta

## Welcome

Welcome to the Base App beta! Coinbase Wallet has evolved into Base—an all-in-one platform where you can create, earn, trade, discover apps, and connect with friends. Thank you for being part of our journey as we build the future of onchain experiences.

## About Base App

**Base is the evolution of Coinbase Wallet.** While we're introducing a completely new experience through this beta, all the features you relied on in Coinbase Wallet remain available in Base App.

The beta introduces enhanced functionality designed to make onchain interactions seamless, social, and accessible to everyone.

---

## Getting Started

### Joining the Beta

The beta is currently available to a limited group of testers. We're progressively expanding access to users on our waitlist.

**To request access:** Visit [base.app](http://www.base.app) and join the waitlist.

### Requirements

The Base App beta requires a **smart wallet**. If you don't have one, you'll create it during the onboarding process.

## Smart Wallets Explained

### What is a Smart Wallet?

A smart wallet is a passkey-secured, self-custodial onchain wallet embedded directly in the Base App. It offers:

- **Easy onboarding** with no seed phrases to manage initially
- **Enhanced security** through passkey authentication
- **Seamless experience** without browser extensions or app switching

### Do I Have a Smart Wallet?

You have a smart wallet if you use a **passkey** to sign onchain transactions. If you have a 12-word recovery phrase, you're using an EOA (Externally Owned Account), not a smart wallet.

**To verify:** Visit wallet.coinbase.com from the in-app browser and log in. Your account details will display "smart wallet" if you have one.

### Creating or Importing a Smart Wallet

During beta onboarding, you'll be prompted to create or import a smart wallet. If you're unsure which option to choose, we recommend creating a new wallet.

## Managing Your Wallets and Funds

### Missing Funds from Previous Coinbase Wallet?

**Your funds are safe.** The Base beta currently supports smart wallets only. If you created a new smart wallet during onboarding, your previous EOA wallet remains accessible in the classic version of the app.

**To access your previous wallet:**
1. Navigate to the **Social tab** (first icon)
2. Tap your **profile picture**
3. Toggle **"beta mode" off**

This returns you to the classic Coinbase Wallet experience where your EOA and funds are available.

## Basenames

### Existing Basename Not Showing Up?

A wallet can use multiple basenames. To use your existing basename with your new smart wallet:

1. **Transfer your basename** from your old wallet to your new smart wallet ([transfer guide](https://docs.base.org/identity/basenames/basenames-faq#10-how-do-i-transfer-my-basename-to-another-address))
2. **Set it as your primary name** on your new wallet ([setup guide](https://docs.base.org/identity/basenames/basenames-faq#9-how-do-i-set-my-basename-as-my-primary-name-for-my-address))

### Basename Visibility on Farcaster

Your basename will be visible to other users in the Base beta. When interacting from other Farcaster clients, your Farcaster username will display if you've connected an account. For new accounts created in Base, your basename becomes your Farcaster username.

---

## Farcaster Integration

### Connecting Your Farcaster Account

1. Open the **Social tab**
2. Engage with any post (like or recast)
3. You'll be prompted to open the Farcaster app
4. Follow the prompts to link Base App to your Farcaster account

### Don't Have a Farcaster Account?

No problem! During beta signup, you'll be prompted to create a social account as part of the onboarding flow.

---

## Beta Mode Controls

### Turning Beta Mode Off

1. Navigate to the **Social tab** (first icon)
2. Tap your **profile picture**
3. Toggle **"beta mode" off**

### Rejoining Beta Mode

1. Navigate to the **Assets tab** (last tab on the right)
2. Select the **settings icon** in the upper right
3. Toggle **"beta mode" on**

## Troubleshooting

### I Reinstalled Base App and Lost Beta Access

Beta invites are single-use. If you uninstall the app, we're unable to restore beta access. However, **your wallets remain fully accessible** as long as you have your:
- Passkeys
- Backup files
- Recovery phrases

Your assets are always safe and recoverable through these methods.

## Launch Timeline

We're working hard to bring Base App to everyone. The official launch date will be announced soon. Thank you for helping us test and improve the experience during this beta phase.
