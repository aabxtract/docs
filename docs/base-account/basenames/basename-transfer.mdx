# Basename Transfer Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through transferring your Basename to a new wallet address. Whether you're upgrading to a smart wallet, switching devices, or consolidating wallets, this process ensures your Basename and all its associated data move safely to your new address.

**Transfer time:** Approximately 5-10 minutes  
**Cost:** Gas fees for 4 transactions (typically $2-5 total depending on network conditions)  
**Prerequisites:** Access to both your current wallet (source) and new wallet (destination)

## Understanding Basename Transfers

### What is a Basename?

Basenames are human-readable identities on Base that replace long wallet addresses with simple names like `yourname.base.eth`. They serve as your onchain identity, linking to your profile, social presence, and blockchain activity.

### Why Transfer Instead of Import?

For security and integrity reasons, Basenames cannot be directly imported or linked to new wallets. A proper transfer ensures:

- **Complete ownership migration** of the NFT and all associated rights
- **Proper resolution** so your Basename points to the correct address
- **Management capabilities** transfer to your new wallet
- **Maintained history** and reputation associated with your name

### What Gets Transferred?

A complete Basename transfer includes four distinct components:

1. **Token Ownership** — The actual Basename NFT and its ownership rights
2. **Management Rights** — Ability to update profile records, avatar, and other metadata  
3. **Address Resolution** — Your Basename will resolve to the new wallet address
4. **NFT Transfer** — The collectible aspect of your Basename

All four transactions must complete for full functionality on your new wallet.

## Before You Start

### Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Access to your current wallet (that owns the Basename)
- [ ] Your new wallet address ready
- [ ] Sufficient ETH in your current wallet for gas fees (~$2-5)
- [ ] A few minutes to complete all transactions

### Important Reminders

> **✓ Use the Official Basenames UI**  
> Always use [base.org/names](https://base.org/names) for transfers. Sending Basenames through marketplaces like OpenSea will only transfer the NFT without updating resolution or management rights.

> **✓ Your New Address is Copied**  
> If you're coming from the Base App onboarding, your new wallet address has been automatically copied to your clipboard. You'll paste this when prompted.

> **✓ Complete All Transactions**  
> You must sign and complete all four transactions in sequence. Partial transfers will result in incomplete functionality.

## Step-by-Step Transfer Process

### Step 1: Access Basenames Dashboard

1. Navigate to [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right
3. Select and connect your **current wallet** (the one that owns the Basename)
4. Sign the connection request when prompted

**Verify:** You should see your wallet address displayed in the top right corner.

### Step 2: Locate Your Basename

1. Click **"My Basenames"** in the navigation menu
2. Browse your owned Basenames
3. Identify the Basename you want to transfer

**Tip:** If you own multiple Basenames, make sure you're selecting the correct one. Your primary name will be indicated with a badge.

### Step 3: Initiate the Transfer

1. Click the **three dots (•••)** next to your selected Basename
2. Select **"Transfer name"** from the dropdown menu
3. A transfer modal will appear

**What you'll see:** A form requesting the destination wallet address and an explanation of what will be transferred.

### Step 4: Enter Destination Address

1. Click into the **"Recipient address"** field
2. **Paste your new wallet address** (Ctrl/Cmd + V)
   - If coming from Base App, the address is already on your clipboard
   - Otherwise, copy your new wallet address from your wallet application
3. **Verify the address** — Double-check that it's correct
4. Click **"Start Transfer"** or **"Continue"**

> **⚠️ Critical:** There is no undo for transfers. Verify the address is correct before proceeding. Sending to the wrong address means permanent loss of your Basename.

### Step 5: Sign All Four Transactions

You'll now be prompted to sign four separate transactions. Each one handles a different aspect of the transfer:

#### Transaction 1: Transfer Token Ownership
- **What it does:** Transfers ownership of the Basename token itself
- **Action:** Sign the transaction in your wallet
- **Wait for:** Confirmation on the blockchain (15-30 seconds)

#### Transaction 2: Transfer Management Rights  
- **What it does:** Grants the new address ability to manage profile records
- **Action:** Sign the transaction in your wallet
- **Wait for:** Confirmation on the blockchain (15-30 seconds)

#### Transaction 3: Update Address Resolution
- **What it does:** Updates which address the Basename resolves to
- **Action:** Sign the transaction in your wallet  
- **Wait for:** Confirmation on the blockchain (15-30 seconds)

#### Transaction 4: Transfer the NFT
- **What it does:** Sends the Basename NFT to the new address
- **Action:** Sign the transaction in your wallet
- **Wait for:** Confirmation on the blockchain (15-30 seconds)

**Progress tracking:** The interface will show which transaction you're on and how many remain.

### Step 6: Confirm Completion

Once all four transactions are confirmed:

1. You'll see a **success message** on screen
2. The Basename will **no longer appear** in your current wallet's "My Basenames"
3. It will now be **visible in your new wallet** (may take a few minutes to update)

---

## Activating Your Basename on the New Wallet

The transfer is complete, but you need to activate the Basename on your new wallet to use it.

### Setting as Primary Name

1. **Disconnect** your old wallet from [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
2. **Connect** your new wallet
3. Navigate to [base.org/manage-names](https://base.org/manage-names)
4. Find your transferred Basename in the list
5. Click the **three dots (•••)** next to the name
6. Select **"Set as primary"**
7. **Sign the transaction** in your new wallet
8. Wait for confirmation

> **Why this matters:** Setting a Basename as primary designates it as your main onchain identity. This is the name that will display across Base apps, profiles, and integrations.

### Verification

After setting as primary, verify everything works:

- [ ] Visit your profile — Your Basename should display correctly
- [ ] Check resolution — Your Basename should resolve to your new address
- [ ] Test in apps — Your Basename should work in Base ecosystem apps
- [ ] View on explorers — Check your Basename on Basescan or similar

## Understanding the Transaction Breakdown

### Why Four Separate Transactions?

Basenames use the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) standard, which separates ownership into distinct components for security and flexibility:

| Transaction | Purpose | What It Controls |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Token Ownership** | Legal ownership of the Basename NFT | Ability to transfer or sell the name |
| **Management Rights** | Authority to modify records | Profile updates, avatar changes, metadata |
| **Address Resolution** | Forward lookup (name → address) | What address your Basename points to |
| **NFT Transfer** | Collectible aspect | Visibility in wallets and marketplaces |

**Security benefit:** This separation prevents partial control scenarios and ensures complete ownership transfers.

### What If I Only Complete Some Transactions?

Incomplete transfers result in split ownership, where:

- You might own the NFT but not control its records
- The name might resolve to the old address
- Management functions won't work on the new wallet

**Solution:** Always complete all four transactions. If interrupted, restart the transfer process.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** "Transaction failed" error

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
- Try increasing gas limit if using custom settings
- Wait a few minutes and retry if network is congested
- Check that you're using the correct source wallet

---

**Issue:** Basename doesn't appear in new wallet after transfer

**Solutions:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for blockchain confirmations and indexing
- Refresh the Basenames page
- Disconnect and reconnect your new wallet
- Check the transaction on Basescan to verify it completed
- Clear browser cache and try again

---

**Issue:** Can't set Basename as primary on new wallet

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all four transfer transactions completed successfully
- Verify you're connected with the new wallet (not the old one)
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet
- Wait a few minutes and retry

---

**Issue:** "Already initiated transfer" message

**Solutions:**
- Complete the pending transfer before starting a new one
- Check your wallet for unsigned transactions
- Refresh the page to see current transfer status

---

**Issue:** Wrong address pasted

**Solutions:**
- If you haven't signed transactions yet: Cancel and restart
- If you've already completed some transactions: Unfortunately, you'll need to complete the transfer to the wrong address, then transfer again to the correct address (additional gas fees apply)
- **Prevention:** Always double-check addresses before signing the first transaction

---

**Issue:** Gas fees seem too high

**Solutions:**
- Check current Base network gas prices
- Wait for lower network congestion (check [base.blockscout.com](https://base.blockscout.com))
- Transfer during off-peak hours (typically weekends or late night US time)
- Remember: All four transactions must complete, so budget accordingly

## Best Practices

### Before Transferring

- **Test the new wallet** — Make sure it works and you have access
- **Backup everything** — Save recovery phrases for both wallets securely
- **Check gas prices** — Transfer during low-congestion periods to save on fees
- **Verify the address** — Triple-check your destination address
- **Screenshot your setup** — Document your current Basename configuration

### During Transfer

- **Stay connected** — Don't close the browser or disconnect your wallet mid-transfer
- **Sign promptly** — Wallet prompts may time out if left too long
- **Monitor progress** — Watch each transaction confirm on-chain
- **Don't refresh** — Let the process complete without interrupting the page

### After Transfer

- **Set as primary immediately** — Activate your Basename on the new wallet right away
- **Update integrations** — Reconnect apps and services that used your old address
- **Test functionality** — Verify everything works before relying on the new setup
- **Keep both wallets** — Retain access to your old wallet for transaction history

## Advanced Scenarios

### Transferring Multiple Basenames

If you own multiple Basenames:

1. Transfer them **one at a time** — The UI handles one transfer at a time
2. Wait for each transfer to **fully complete** before starting the next
3. Consider which should be **primary** on your new wallet
4. Budget **gas fees** for all transfers (4 transactions × number of names)

### Transferring to a Multi-Sig Wallet

For added security, you can transfer to a multi-sig:

1. Ensure the multi-sig contract **supports NFTs** (ERC-721)
2. Use the multi-sig address as the destination
3. All signers must **approve** setting the name as primary
4. Test with a less important name first if available

### Transferring from a Smart Wallet

If transferring from a Base smart wallet:

1. The process is **identical** to EOA transfers
2. Use your smart wallet's **signing interface**
3. Transactions may look different but achieve the same result
4. Gas fees are typically similar or slightly lower

## Security Considerations

### Protecting Your Basename

- **Never share** recovery phrases or private keys
- **Verify URLs** — Only use official base.org domains
- **Double-check addresses** — One wrong character means permanent loss
- **Use hardware wallets** — For high-value or important Basenames
- **Enable 2FA** — On any accounts related to your wallets

### Recognizing Scams

**Red flags:**
- Messages claiming your Basename needs "urgent verification"
- Requests to transfer your Basename to "update" or "verify" it
- Unofficial websites mimicking base.org
- DMs offering to help with transfers (official support won't DM first)

**Remember:** Legitimate transfers are always initiated by YOU through the official Basenames UI.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I transfer my Basename to someone else?**  
A: Yes! Follow the same process but use their wallet address as the destination. They'll need to set it as primary on their wallet.

**Q: How much does it cost to transfer?**  
A: Gas fees only, typically $2-5 total for all four transactions on Base. Prices vary with network congestion.

**Q: Can I cancel a transfer after starting?**  
A: Only if you haven't signed any transactions yet. Once you sign, individual transactions can't be reversed, but you can transfer again to a different address (paying gas fees again).

**Q: Will I lose my profile picture and bio?**  
A: No, all profile data and records transfer with your Basename.

**Q: Can I transfer a Basename I'm leasing/renting?**  
A: Only if you own it. Leased names can only be transferred by the actual owner.

**Q: What if I send it to a wrong address?**  
A: If you control that address, you can transfer it again to the correct one. If you don't control it, the Basename is lost. Always verify addresses carefully.

**Q: Do I need to re-register after transferring?**  
A: No, your Basename remains registered. You're just changing which wallet owns it.
